	<h1>NASA's Moon Website</h1>
	<p>NASA's Moon Website had a lot of interesting content regarding the moon, NASA, news, and much more.  When it came to sorting all of this material, I found it somewhat challenging after having seen how it is sorted on the page.  Once I began to sort the content cards, however, I did make some adjustments to the way it was organized on NASA's page. </p>
	<h2>Card Sorting</h2>

	<p>The table above displays the way I sorted the content cards from NASA's Moon website.  I came up with some new categories that organized the content a little differently, as well as keeping some of the original ones on NASA's website.  After sorting the cards, I had created separate 'News' and 'Events' categories.  This moved some of the content around as well as splitting up content that is in the 'News & Events' category on NASA's page.  My category 'Missions' and 'Strategic Partners' was relatively the same due to the use of the word 'missions' under that category as well as the partners affiliation to NASA.</p>
